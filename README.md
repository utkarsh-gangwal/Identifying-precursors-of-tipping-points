# Identifying-precursors-of-tipping-points
The real-world networks are vulnerable to sudden collapse and may enter a region from where the recovery of these networked infrastructure systems becomes very difficult. Here, we aim to identify the critical thresholds or the tipping points and also propose an approach to identify the warning regions.

The files present in the folder 'Attack models' helps simulate perturbations due to random failures and targeted attacks. The file tipping&warning_points provides a method to identify the tipping points and warning regions.
